<br><br>
Well, if that chief guy sent you then I have no choice.
<br><br>
Well maybe it's because of the pirates. Maybe that's why they just all the humans now? You should go get rid of the pirates first. But why do you want to know such things anyway?
<br><br>

<br><br>

<br><br>
Well, I have something useful I drew up before. Yes, yes, I don't have the time to make you a new one. That's okay right? I have something I drew up thinking maybe we can get some help from Goddess Parna after the Frost Guard appeared.
<br><br>
It could have been used if the lake wasn't blocked off. I am glad you will be able to get the blessing.^
