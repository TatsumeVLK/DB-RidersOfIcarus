^E13_Talk_007^,^What's going on over there?!^
^n05_Talk_001^,^Focus, recruits!^
^n05_Talk_002^,^For His Majesty!^
^n05_Talk_003^,^Who is it that keeps missing their timing? Focus!^
^n05_Talk_004^,^Do it right, unless you want to repeat the drill a thousand more times!^
^E14_Talk_001^,^The traitor is getting away!^

^E16_Talk_005^,^Yum, a shield crab! Perfect timing. I'm starving.^
^E16_Talk_006^,^Ouch! That hurt! Somebody help me!^
^E16_Talk_007^,^Jeez, all I wanted was something to eat.^
^E16_Talk_008^,^We need to get the entrance device from Sharon and head to Frost Castle.^
^E16_Talk_009^,^How dare you challenge me? Do you know who I am?^
^E16_Talk_010^,^That's right. I won. So let's just go. Please? I hate pirates!^
^E16_Talk_011^,^If we let go, it's over.^
^E16_Talk_012^,^Attack with us! We can't let him get away!^
^E16_Talk_013^,^It all came out at once!^
^E16_Talk_014^,^Come on, you weaklings!^
^E16_Talk_015^,^Our plan was discovered. I'm going to KILL them!^
^E16_Talk_016^,^Oh, don't worry! I'm going to kill them all!^
^E16_Talk_017^,^Help me!^
^E16_Talk_018^,^My money...^

^d02_Tolk_112^,^Turn back!^
^d02_Tolk_113^,^Before I kill you all...^
^d02_Tolk_114^,^Aisha... I'm sorry...^
^d02_Tolk_201^,^How dare you bring bloodshed to this place?^
^d02_Tolk_202^,^I'll take care of them, count.^

^f01_alen_002^,^If the forest keeps burning at this rate...^
^f01_alen_003^,^The fire is spreading... Where is everyone?^
^f01_e01_009^,^Well, that's taken care of. Now let's go after the chief.^
^f01_e01_010^,^Is it over? Do the dead finally rest?^
^f01_e01_011^,^Come here when you're ready.^
^f01_e01_012^,^Good work. He's caused enough trouble.^
^f01_e02_001^,^Hurry! Go to Crow!^
^f01_e02_002^,^I can't go on anymore...^
^f01_e02_003^,^Complete...the ritual...^
^f01_e02_004^,^You shall not pass.^
^f01_e02_005^,^I can't believe you made it all the way here.^
^f01_e02_006^,^Let me be the first to welcome you to your doom.^
^f01_e02_007^,^Deal with these interlopers. I must return to my work.^
^f01_e02_008^,^They still stand against us? Crush them!^
^f01_e02_009^,^I asked only for the time to do our lord's bidding...^
^f01_e01_013^,^Complete...the ritual...^
^f01_e02_010^,^Oh, good. I made it in time.^
^f01_e02_011^,^The barrier has finally been destroyed! Hurry! To the capital's shrine!^
^f01_e01_014^,^Don't you dare think it's because I'm afraid... of HIM.^
^f01_e01_015^,^Ta da! Here's the Shimmerwood! I'll wait for you at camp.^
^f01_e01_016^,^Look at those trees! How they shine, glimmer, sparkle!^

^f01_e01_020^,^Do you see those sparkling trees?^
^f01_e01_021^,^Hey! Do you know about Elquines, the fairy queen?^
^f01_e01_022^,^Once upon a time, she was beautiful and good.^
^f01_e01_023^,^She was blessed by Ellora herself.^
^f01_e01_024^,^And this entire forest was filled with shimmering trees.^
^f01_e01_025^,^But then the people of Exarahn came, and they uprooted the trees and massacred our people.^
^f01_e01_026^,^Not many shimmering trees remain.^
^f01_e01_027^,^Elquines has become a creature of unquenchable fury.^
^f01_e01_028^,^The fairies have changed. Our plants have changed.^
^f01_e01_029^,^Not long ago, Princess Lania said she found a way to restore us.^
^f01_e01_030^,^But the princess never returned, and Elquines's rage knows no bounds...^
^f01_e01_031^,^Hurry up! We're almost there!^
^f01_e01_032^,^There's a camp right there!^
^f01_e01_033^,^A bit faster! Faster! Faster!^

^c01_worzword_3^,^I'm running outta breath!^
^c01_worzword_4^,^Did you hear the news from the highlands?^
^c01_worzword_5^,^It's pretty scary stuff!^
^c01_worzword_6^,^They say there are vampires everywhere.^
^c01_worzword_7^,^And the count went completely mad.^
^c01_worzword_8^,^The count was a great man. I wonder what happened...^
^c01_worzword_9^,^Salant has to be behind this, right?^
^c01_worzword_10^,^Hurry, hurry!^
^c01_worzword_11^,^We're almost there!^
^c01_worzword_12^,^I'll take you to the crossroad.^

^f04_last_012^,^If they take the Ellora megalith, it's over. Do not let them take it!^
^f04_last_013^,^Hold it! Just a little longer...^
^f04_last_014^,^Deserters will be executed!^
^f04_last_015^,^Healer! We need a healer!^
^f04_last_016^,^How much longer until our Pegasus support arrives?^
^f04_last_017^,^Is the Ellora megalith safe?^
^f04_last_018^,^Hurry, the Fallen Legion is near!^

^f04_last_026^,^Their attack is weakening. Just hold out a bit longer...^
^f04_last_027^,^We will triumph soon.^
^f04_last_028^,^Is it over now...?^
^f04_last_029^,^We've done it! We've stopped them!^

^f04_lilis_001^,^Don't just wander around. Kill them!^
^f04_lilis_002^,^My, my, aren't you determined? I like that.^
^f04_lilis_003^,^Lilith despises pathetic creatures who cling to life.^
^f04_lilis_004^,^You can't die yet! We still have a lot to do.^
^f04_lilis_005^,^I've been letting things slide, but no more! Lilith MAD!^
^f04_lilis_006^,^Die! Die! Ahahahahaha!^
^f04_lilis_007^,^How DARE you force Lilith's hand! Die! All of you, die!^

^c01_reaction_001^,^Greetings, friend. I am Rufala, servant to the Goddess Ellora.^
^c01_reaction_002^,^Allow me to teach you some advanced combat tactics.^
^c01_reaction_003^,^Powerful enemies tend to be resistant to certain status effects.^
^c01_reaction_004^,^In order to breach their defenses, you must first destabilize them.^
^c01_reaction_005^,^(Certain skills destabilize enemies when you land a critical hit.)^
^c01_reaction_006^,^It usually takes a few hits to destabilize an enemy.^
^c01_reaction_007^,^I'll grant you a blessing that will temporarily improve your chance to destabilize your enemy.^
^c01_reaction_008^,^And now to summon a monster. Try to destabilize it.^
^c01_reaction_009^,^Completely destabilize the enemy, then defeat it!^
^c01_reaction_010^,^Very good. Did you get the hang of it?^
^c01_reaction_011^,^Enemies with perfect stability are a threat. Don't let them keep their advantage.^
^c01_reaction_012^,^You can tell whether an enemy has stability by observing it carefully.^
^c01_reaction_013^,^Again. Destabilize the enemy!^
^c01_reaction_014^,^You're getting the hang of it now. I'm proud to have trained you.^
^c01_reaction_015^,^May Ellora's blessing be with you.^
^c01_reactionotice_01^,^Defeat the enemy by breaking their stability with critical hits.^
^c01_reactionotice_02^,^Defeat the enemy by breaking their stability with critical hits.^
^c01_reactionotice_03^,^Report to Virtue Linetta.^
