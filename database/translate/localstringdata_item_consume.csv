<b>How to Tame Big Bears</b><br>
Big bears can only be tamed from the back of another familiar. <br>First, you'll need a regular familiar. 
Then, you'll need to approach your target and leap your familiar and use the Tame skill before jumping again. <br><br>
It's a difficult maneuver to achieve and you have to be quick on your toes, but well worth the effort.^
