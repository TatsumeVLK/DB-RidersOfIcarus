^Dialog_1050001_Text1^,^Believe me, if I could get the merumi to open the lake up again, I would. I figure they've got issues with the elder letting every stray he meets into town, but that's nothing compared to the problems these pirates are giving us.^
^Dialog_1050001_Text1_attach_0^,^<br><br>Anyway, this isn't the time to worry about the merumi. We've got pirates to worry about. If you want to help out, talk to Angela. She's got one hell of a grudge against them.^

^Dialog_1050002_Text0^,^Come to share in our misery, traveler? Between the bitter cold and the ruthless pirates, it's a wonder any of us are still alive. Reedwatch isn't what it used to be. Even my son has run off to join the pirates.^
^Dialog_1050002_Text1^,^The people are Reedwatch are strong. We'll make it through this. My son has a lot of growing yet to do, but he'll be a fine citizen someday.^

^Dialog_1050004_Text0^,^I've never seen you before. And if you've got any sense, you'll clear out of here quick as you can. The pirates show mercy to no one. My folks learned that the hard way...^
^Dialog_1050004_Text1^,^I'm sure I don't know why the merumi are giving us the cold shoulder. You ought to ask the alchemist about it. He's chock full of useless information.^

^Dialog_1050019_Text0^,^I'm always happy to welcome a fellow knight to the camp. Most of these lazy mercenaries do the bare minimum to earn their pay.^
^Dialog_1050019_Text1^,^Our negligence allowed the pirates to gain a foothold on Parna's Coast. Once I've whipped this garrison into shape, we'll drive the pirates out once and for all.^

^Dialog_1050020_Text1^,^So, you took care of the pirate menace. Damn, I wish I could've seen their faces when you killed 'em.^

^Dialog_1050040_Text0^,^I never should have agreed to this. These merumi don't even have a concept of proper nobility! I thought it would be a nice getaway from the estate in Hakain's Crossing, but at this point I'll be happy if I never see another fish face again.^

^Dialog_1050046_Text1^,^The keep gate is a feat of engineering, let me tell you. All kinds of nasty traps and locking mechanisms to keep intruders out.
