^Dialog_9015160_Text0^,^Princess Lania visited Brakarr Forest in secret once. She wanted to rally us soldiers fighting the braghins, and that's just what she did.^
^Dialog_9015170_Title^,^Braghins^
^Dialog_9015170_Text0^,^The braghins came out of nowhere. The fact that the mustered so close to Hakain's Crossing is a mark against the Dragon Knights.^
^Dialog_9015180_Title^,^Taming Methods^
^Dialog_9015180_Text0^,^I studied at the Familiar Academy, and let me tell you, we take taming very seriously. To tame the beast, you must think like the beast, respect the beast, love the beast...^

^Dialog_9015350_Title^,^Fairies^
^Dialog_9015350_Text0^,^The fairies here are way different from the fairies I read about in my youth. They were supposed to be playful and gentle, but all of them, including Elquines, are filled with hate and rage. They want to kill us whenever they see us. Princess Lania was the only person the fairies didn't attack.^
^Dialog_9015360_Title^,^Taming Conditions^

^Dialog_9015400_Title^,^Princess Lania and the Fairies^

^Dialog_9015410_Title^,^Princess Lania and the Fairies 2^
^Dialog_9015410_Text0^,^Princess Lania spoke with the fairies and made a promise to Queen Elquines. For a while, the fairies stopped attacking humans... until now.^
^Dialog_9015420_Title^,^Princess Lania and the Fairies^
^Dialog_9015420_Text0^,^People used to view fairies as common monsters. Princess Lania, on the other hand, recognized the beauty of the Shimmerwood and its caretakers.^
^Dialog_9015430_Title^,^Princess Lania's Promise^
^Dialog_9015430_Text0^,^I'm not sure what it could have been. Perhaps she wanted to give her something. Maybe she promised Elquines a husband!^

^Dialog_9015460_Title^,^Favorite Sow^
^Dialog_9015460_Text0^,^My favorite sow, Mio, used to get herself into all sorts of mischief.
