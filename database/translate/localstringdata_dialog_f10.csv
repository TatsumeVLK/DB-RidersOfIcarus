^dialog_6000002_text0^,^It is said that there are very few people who have recently visited Magmapora.<br>It is because the Magmaphora transport ship has stopped operating due to the demon army's interference.<br>It seems that rumors about you newcomer have been inflated beyond imagination.

My parents got into an accident on the Turimran side of the Red Hammer. It's a pity.^
