I have a job for you (since my hand is too noble for this), I need you to cook something for me. I’ll need tons of meat to recover my physical condition. Let’s share this feast once you finished cooking, isn’t that great?

^Co^,^Common^,^ev_vf_0002_05_Request_Text^,^The blood moon, It is considered a legend back in my hometown, a story for children perhaps. But it seems just a common talk here in the town as if its real. Listen, I remember the day I turned… I am certain I had a vision of the blood moon turning humans mad and having thirst for human blood and flesh. I have always doubt my visions, but this time I’ll have to follow my instincts.

I have a job for you commoner and your friends. I need you to bring me a blood sample of any strong creatures under the influence of the blood moon. I need to study them, because they might have our answers for the cure. 

This won’t be an easy task, but with help it is possible.

^Co^,^Common^,^ev_vf_0002_05_Accepted_Text^,^Good, good. While you’re at it, I’ll find some apothecary to help me study the blood and my blood too. Be careful commoner.^
