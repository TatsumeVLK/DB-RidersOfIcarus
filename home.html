            <p>I realized that the equations are completely wrong, I'm looking for the place that makes these equations, and I'm going to change from | Fellow > Sealed | to | Fellow > Fellows | it should be easier to show them</p>

            <p>I haven't logged into the game yet to check if the equations are correct, and there are still some effects to translate.</p>
            <p>Fellows are complex, involving dozens of files working together.</p>

            <p class="lime">If you try to use an effect, and it is not translated, please wait for new updates.</p>
            <p class="lime">I'm going to start making fellows, so there will probably be a lot of effects that don't have a translation yet.</p>

            <p>When loading the site, the first code is bugged, but you can change items by clicking on the items in the menu on the left.</p>
            <p>The word Ring, in the files I have, the R is always capitalized, even if it is part of a sentence like TempeRing, DuRing, etc.
                But I'm already thinking of a way to replace it, don't worry.</p>

            <h2 class="yellow">Work in progress:</h2>
            <p>I still need to do a lot to make it good, but for those who don't have anything, it's already a good start. 
                I'm still a bit confused about some things, for example, the icon file that I have for some reason doesn't list all the items that are in the game, 
                so I'll check if I missed any files.</p>
            <p>Tomorrow I want to see if I can get the photos of the missing necklaces, and translate the effects correctly.</p>

            <br>
            <p>Hi everyone, I'm developing a website to make it easier to create and edit game items, based on the database I got from this website, 
                so I'd like to share this project with you. I'm updating it every day, 
                so I'd love to hear your feedback and use it to improve the website.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I originally wanted to create this site because I couldn't find any site that listed all the items in the game.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="darkred">Some items don't have images because I couldn't extract the game files to get these images, so if you notice, 
                they're screenshots that I haven't cropped yet.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The website is in beta, so to speak, so it's still far from being ready, I hope you understand.</p>
            <br>
            <p class="lime">I plan to create a tab for creating items from scratch, that is, you will select everything that the item will have, 
                and the site will give you the code for all the files that you will need to edit for this, 
                but I will leave that to do after I have completed the entire database first.</p>
